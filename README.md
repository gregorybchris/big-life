# Big Life

Web implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Only cells visible on screen and living cells off screen are explicitly stored. This allows larger patterns to be tracked using less space and time.

## Setup

```bash
# Install TypeScript
npm install typescript

# Build the TypeScript to JavaScript based on tsconfig.json
tsc --build

# Start a webserver and open index.html
```
